* Requirements
- Python 3.8
- Pip
- Pipenv (installed by running: pip install pipenv)

* Development setup
** Setup Python virtual environment using pipenv
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# make sure you are in backend/ when running these commands
pipenv install # this will install all the python packages needed for this project
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| Installing dependencies from Pipfile.lock (453528)â€¦ |                                                      |
| To activate this project's virtualenv               | run pipenv shell.                                    |
| Alternatively                                       | run a command inside the virtualenv with pipenv run. |



** Entering the virtual environment using pipenv
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# make sure you are in backend/ when running these commands
pipenv shell
#+END_SRC

All further instructions assume that you are are in a pipenv shell

** Using django
*** Starting the development server
The server will automatically reload when any changes are detected. If database
models are changed however (~models.py~), see Troubleshooting below.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python manage.py runserver
#+END_SRC



* Troubleshooting
** Did you make changes to the database models and you now get inconsistencies or errors?
Run the following commands to update the database to match the models.
Remember to commit the files created when this command is run, when changes to
the django models has been made.

First, stop the server if it is running, then execute the following commands,
and restart the server again.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# in backend/ and in pipenv shell environment
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
#+END_SRC
